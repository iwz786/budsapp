      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>BudsApp Technologies</strong>
        ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information
        when you use the <strong>Buds App</strong> mobile application
        (the "App"). Buds App is a productivity-focused super app offering
        features such as parcel delivery, on-demand services, and e-commerce.
      </p>

      <p>
        By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in
        accordance with this Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>1.1 Personal Information</h3>
      <p>We may collect the following personal information when you use the App:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Name</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Email address</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Phone number</strong></li>
        <li>
          <strong>Photos or videos</strong> (for example, as proof of parcel
          pickup or delivery, or to support specific on-demand services)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This information is primarily used for account creation, verification,
        authentication, notifications, and to complete orders or service
        requests placed through the App.
      </p>

      <h3>1.2 Location Information</h3>
      <p>
        The App uses your <strong>GPS location</strong> to enable features such
        as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Determining parcel pickup and drop-off points</li>
        <li>Assigning nearby service providers</li>
        <li>Improving the accuracy of on-demand services</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Location data is used to provide core functionality of the App. We do
        not use location data for unrelated purposes such as selling location
        data to third parties.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3 Information We Do Not Intentionally Collect</h3>
      <p>As of now, we do <strong>not</strong> intentionally collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Payment card details (credit/debit card numbers, CVV, etc.)</li>
        <li>Device identifiers for our own databases</li>
        <li>IP addresses in our own systems</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please note that some of the third-party services we use (such as
        Firebase or Google services) may automatically collect device and
        usage-related information as part of their normal operations. Their
        data practices are described in their respective privacy policies.
      </p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We use the information we collect for the following purposes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To create and manage user accounts</li>
        <li>To provide and operate parcel delivery and on-demand services</li>
        <li>To send service-related notifications (e.g., order updates)</li>
        <li>To authenticate users (via email, phone, or third-party sign-in)</li>
        <li>To support third-party integrations (e.g., Google services)</li>
        <li>To monitor and fix errors and improve App reliability</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If we enable analytics in the future (such as Google Analytics for
        Firebase), we may also use anonymized or aggregated data to understand
        how users interact with the App and improve our features and
        performance.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        We use third-party services to operate certain features of the App.

      </ul>
      <p>
        We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these providers to
        understand how they handle data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Google &amp; Firebase Privacy Policy: 
          <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

      </ul>

        <li><strong>AWS secured servers</strong> (for backend services and storage)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your
        information, including restricted access, secure communication
        channels, and security best practices on our cloud infrastructure.
        However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we
        cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>
